Rewrite the Path URL
Whenever there is a change in the URLs, we often rewrite the path of the backend server endpoints. We can do that with the pathRewrite.
Letâ€™s understand the pathRewrite option. For instance, our backend URL /api/settings is changed to 
/api/app/settings and we want to test in development before it goes to production. We can achieve this with the option pathRewrite like below.

const { createProxyMiddleware } = require('http-proxy-middleware');

module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(
    '/api/*',
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: 'http://localhost:3080',
      changeOrigin: true,
      pathRewrite: {
        '^/api/settings': '/api/app/settings'
      },
    })
  );
};
